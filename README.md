# Nexarion (temporary)

This is a repo hosting a set of sort-of design documents for an experimental indie game project. The game is intended to be like [Uncharted Waters IV](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1424800/Uncharted_Waters_IV_HD_Version/), but in a far-future setting and with some slightly different mechanics.

Motivated by the disappointing PC remaster / port of Uncharted Waters IV.
