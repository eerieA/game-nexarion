# General ideas

A bunch of intrinsic thoughts of making this game. Following the guideline of design lenses in the famous [The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Game-Design-Lenses-Third-dp-1138632058/dp/1138632058). A few of the lenses are skipped, for conciseness (although not too much).

## Essential Experience

- What experience do I want the player to have?

    To be a curious or brave adventurer in uncertain times, through traveling, trading and geographical explorations.

- What is essential to this experience?

    The feeling of discovering new parts of a rich world every short while. Much like discovering new cities in Uncharted Waters IV or, in a more real-world sense, much like learning a new cuisine, color name, etc, and its origin story each day. One does need to overcome some difficulties but the joy of exploration makes it worthwhile.

- How can my game capture that essece?

    It can provide simulated explorations with some hardships, and then reward the player with new cities (main attraction), characters, lores.
    
    Maybe also hazards like solar winds, space debris, to capture the essential feeling of conquoring dangers.

## Surprise

- What will suprise players when they play my game?

    Maybe the novelty of a slightly less grand and thus a bit eccentric space opera world. Most of the space opera stories are about heros saving worlds. Mine might incorporate some nihilism, but not as sour as that of the Cyberpunk franchise.

    I want to surprise them by slighly new systems like smuggling, which will facilitate some alternate gameplay style that was not provided by some big competitors.

    I would like to surprise them by the tight integration of the fictional cultures with the explorable ports, which some competitors do not have. But this may not be very important.

- Does the story in my game have surprises? The game rules, artwork, technology?

    The game rules and technology probably will not have surprises because this game is trying to build on the systems of an already well-liked gameplay, and it will be a traditional PC game, no new interaction devices, etc.

    The story hopefull will have surprises, supported by the unique-ish world setting.

    I also hope the faction alignment system and random event system will give surprises, because these were proven to add varity and controled unpredictability in gameplay.

- Do my rules give players ways to surprise each other?

    Maybe through how different the exploration "graph" can be for different playthroughs and different players. Kind of like how Disco Elysium does it through its attribute system.
    
    Uncharted Waters IV lets player have different routes by selecting from 7 protagnists, which feels a bit less varified because each starts from one continent, and the early trade rountines are largely limited by the mapping to the real-world earth geography. This potentially makes two players who choose the same protagnist to natrually settle on very similar routes.

- Do my rules give players ways to surprise themselves?

    Maybe how their political inclination in the game differ from their real-world one. I do want to allude to real-world geopolitical ideologies and conflicts a lot. But we will see. ðŸ˜†
