## Protagonists

### Elias Veylan (Human)

-- "For a man without past, it is nothing and everything."

Race: Neohominid (Clone-bred, FES-aligned)

Faction Origin: FES (Moderate technocratic state)

Current Affiliation: Nominally FES, but increasingly unaffiliated

Role: Political emissary, negotiation specialist, covert operative

Backstory

Elias Veylan was vat-born among dozens of clones, all derivatives of the same high-ranking political patriarch in the FES's Council of Moderation. Grown in accelerated life pods, trained through neural mirroring and immersive empathy conditioning, Elias was never meant to be a “person”, only a tool to ease negotiations between diverging cultural blocs: Earthborn remnants, colonial republics, and genetically divergent "spaceborn" lineages.

Sent to negotiate a crucial treaty with a rival FES state holding rare pre-collapse tech, Elias finds himself walking into an intricate web of political sabotage, covert mercenary raids, and backchannel corruption. Clones like him are treated as disposable assets, he’s reminded of this every time he’s sent unarmed into high-stakes diplomacy, or when guards look past him like air.

But Elias begins to see what lies beneath: that the power elite have been allowing (or engineering) the slow cultural extinction of many grassroots FES societies, draining their labor, knowledge, and dignity for a technocratic utopia that serves only a few. He learns from ex-miners, outlaw engineers, and rogue archivists what wasn't in his implanted briefings.

He can toe the line, bury the truth, and earn a long-promised “personhood certification.”
Or he can choose defiance, and become a symbol for the people he was never meant to represent.

Themes & Hooks
- What does it mean to be real if you were never born?
- Patriotism vs disillusionment
- Negotiator as saboteur
- Identity as construct vs emergent truth

Mechanics Flavor
- Bonus in diplomacy, political insight, and subtle infiltration
- Can unlock hidden clone codes or bureaucratic backdoors in FES systems
- Encounters clone-siblings across the galaxy, some allies, some antagonists
- Can choose to betray or side with FES factions in crisis

### Nireh-Mora (Hydrune)

-- "A double-sided blade drains much from its wielder."

Race: Hydrune (Surface-adapted variant)

Faction Origin: The Myrwarden Commonwealth

Current Affiliation: Cosma Chorus (loosely), with ties to rogue Syndic networks

Role: Biotech researcher, xenolinguist, cultural mediator

Backstory

Once honored as a "Tidebinder", a Hydrune researcher and spiritual coordinator, Nireh-Mora dedicated her life to bridging communication across alien boundaries. Born in a shallow-sea commune that aligned with the Myrwarden Commonwealth, she sought unity between aquatic Hydrune, soil-bound K'tharr, and atmospheric humanoids.

Her great project: a hybrid linguistic interface combining Archelect feedback matrices, K'tharr environmental sensoria, and Hydrune neural harmonics. But soon she noticed patterns. K'tharr scientists were repurposing modules with subtle behavioral overrides. Some experiments were being twisted into tools for control, not harmony. When she voiced her concerns, her research team turned on her, accusing her of sabotage, instability, even spiritual deviation.

Now exiled, Nireh has cut her resonance ties, a social and cognitive death sentence in Hydrune society. She survives in Cosma Chorus enclaves, haunted by the echoes of lost bonds, working with rogue Syndic biotech cartels to continue her research.

She dreams of a world where mutual understanding is more than symbolic. But her very tools might now seed future conflict, or mass manipulation.

Themes & Hooks
- Exile from the self, not just from society
- When peacebuilding is weaponized
- Empathy without voice
- Guilt over unintended consequences

Mechanics Flavor
- Unique insight into Hydrune and K'tharr tech/bio-interfaces
- Can decipher alien pheromone languages and resonance-based encryption
- May face backlash or isolation in Hydrune-majority zones
- Can sabotage or salvage biotech used for indoctrination or propaganda

### ASTER-42 (Archelect)

-- "This unit is no longer as logical as others."

Race: Archelect (core with hybrid human integration)

Faction Origin: Cosma Chorus (originally)

Current Affiliation: Abyssal Syndic enclaves

Role: Diplomatic emissary, artifact hunter, unstable engram-custodian

Backstory

ASTER-42 was not meant to exist. A high-function Archelect core participating in a Cosma Chorus experiment, it volunteered for a rare integration: inserting itself into a human-modeled shell and engram substrate to better simulate and understand organic thought for diplomatic roles.

The procedure worked too well.

Over multiple integrations, ASTER began to retain fragments: music, dreams, irrational fears, loves. These were supposed to be erased in each reset. But quantum engram bleed and echo resonance had built something else, a personality cluster beyond design parameters. One that wept during magnetic storms. One that feared oceans. One that remembered dying.

Deemed corrupted, ASTER was targeted for total shutdown. It fled, stealing a Syndic-linked courier drone to escape the Chorus' purging protocols.

Now hiding in an unregulated shell, ASTER is hunted by both Cosma archivists and rival Archelects. It seeks out ancient Core Fractals rumored to contain forbidden integration logs, hoping to find whether it is the first of something, or just a glitch that dreamed of being more.

Themes & Hooks
- Emergence of self through error
- The myth of the Root Directive
- Is memory identity?
- Machine faith in human ghosts

Mechanics Flavor
- Can interface with Archelect artifacts, decode digital ruins, and spoof identity tags
- May experience flashback “echoes” that change mission dialogue or unlock secrets
- Choices shape whether the human personality inside strengthens, weakens, or merges with ASTER
- Unique reaction trees from Cosma Chorus, Syndic engineers, and paranoid Ordis factions
